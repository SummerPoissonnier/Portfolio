Fuel Consumption A4 Project Notes:

While creating the code for this assignment, I found that I struggled a 
little bit. I had to import csv for this assignment, the 
easiest part. I realized I struggled because I needed to go back to 
the text-book and reread chapter 7. I relied heavily on google and 
example 7.15 to help me with option 1 for the code. Option 1 took me a 
very long time,but once I figured it out, I was very pleased with 
myself. I ended up creating a function for the mileage and created a 
list of tuples and I also created a function to find the interval 
mileage and save this as a list aswell. For option 2 I used example 
7.17 in the book. This example really helped me because I did not know 
how to create a graph in Python. At first I ran into the issue that
Pylab would not import for me. Once I followed a video and installed it,
pylab still would not work for me. So I did my best to code without
being able to test my graphs as nothing I did seemed to work with pylab.
Overall, this assignment took me a lot of time and I spent more time
stuck trying to import pylab than anything else. If I had more time I 
would try to get pylab to work for me and try to attempt the extra credit.
