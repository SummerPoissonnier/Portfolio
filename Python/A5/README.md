Iris A5 Project Notes:

Upon creating this assignment, I started off by coding my description
of the app and then opening the iris.csv file since this is still fresh
in my memory from the previous assignment. I then started to create
a dictionary for the attributes of the file and a dictionary to sort
through the values in the file. I also used a function for the averages 
and a function to print the results. Printing the results in a pretty
way was very easy as it was similar to previous assignments I did
in other coding classes. I think the most difficult part of the assignment
was coding for the dictionaries and the averages. If I had more time I
would figure out how to format my averages so they all line up in a nicer
way since I could not figure that out for some reason, I tried {:.2f}
with the built in .format but it would not work.
