Caesar Cipher A2 Project Notes:

Upon creating this code, I did some light research on 
what the caesarian cipher is and how it works.
Upon researching, I learned how to encrypt and decrypt phrases.
At first, I was not sure where to begin with my code. 
It took me a while to figure out that I needed to apply the 
same algorithm I found online in my code. To encrpyt a phrase,
I realized that I needed to add in my algorithm. To decrypt
a phrase, I realized I needed to subract. In each algorithm
I had to use modulus 26. Once I figured this out, I started 
to code in bits and pieces. I first created a description
of the app. I then created all of my prompts to the user. After
this, I began the code for the encryption. The first bit I 
coded for was for capital letters, then lowercase letters. I
repeated this process for decryption. I used a lot of 
conditional statements in my code including for if the user
wanted to encrypt or decrypt and if the letters were upper
or lowercase. Once I perfected this part of my code, I went 
back and realized I needed to use a while loop. I prompted the
user before my while loop and asked them if they wanted to 
play. My while loop ran if the user said yes (Y) and would quit
if the user gave any other answer. I had to copy my previous 
code for encrypt/decrypt and paste it into my while loop. After
the while loop, I prompted the user one last time asking if 
they wanted to play again. If yes, the while loop will run 
again until they say no. I think some improvements I could 
make in my code would be adding more details for the user
and including more limitations in what they can and cannot do.
